## 💬 About Me
Hi! I am a passionate full-stack developer who, alongside a full time job, committed 20 hours weekly to master React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL under senior developers at LearningFuze. 

With 6 years of experience in product management, I offer a unique UX perspective combined with a drive to tackle complex challenges, collaborate, and learn continuously, making me a valuable asset to any team.

From startups to non-profits and medium sized corporations, no matter the role or industry, I bring to the table initiative, adaptability, creativity, problem solving intuition and unique customer relation skills, which translate directly to increased company revenues.
