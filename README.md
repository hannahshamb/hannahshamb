## 💬 About Me
Hi! I am a full stack software developer that works in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with a passion for languages, solving puzzles, and collaborating with others to achieve common goals. 

From startups to non-profits and medium sized corporations, no matter the role or industry, I bring to the table initiative, adaptability, creativity, problem solving intuition and unique customer relation skills, which translate directly to increased company revenues.

As a developer, I plan to continue to use my breadth of experience and skills to learn new tools and continuously grow in any team that I am on.
